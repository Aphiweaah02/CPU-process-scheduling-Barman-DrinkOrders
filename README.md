# CPU-process-scheduling-Barman-DrinkOrders
A Simulation of process scheduling in a bar scenario, where patrons arrive randomly and place drink orders.mplementations of both First Come First Served (FCFS) and Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithms. This project explores and compares the efficiency of scheduling algorithms(SJF and FCFS) in handling drink orders at the bar.
